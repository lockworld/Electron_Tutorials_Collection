## TutorialsPoint: Electron Tutorial

Overall, this has been a very good tutorial. I feel like I understand what I'm working with more, but that could just be because this is the second tutorial I've followed.

There are still many cases where this tutorial is importing modules into renderer directly, which I thought was a no-no, but I guess it's just done for simplicity. Or maybe it's not as dangerous as I thought...maybe it's just that you shouldn't `require('electron')`, but you can `require('other-modules')`.


## Multi-use repository
I am using this repository as a storage place for a variety of tutorials that I am following as I try to learn Electron. Each tutorial is tracked on a separate branch.
