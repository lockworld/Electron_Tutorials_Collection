## Multi-use repository
I am using this repository as a storage place for a variety of tutorials that I am following as I try to learn Electron. 

I got sick of making a new repository for each, since they were all only used briefly and then kept around for reference, but not changed often.

In this repository, I will try to make a new branch for every tutorial that I follow so each will have a clean code base that applies only to that tutorial.
